        <h1>Week 2 Blog Post</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>This week I wanted to explore more about the physics that we experience whe browsing through webpages. 
            A friend of mine who is a web developer explained to me some years ago that much of the moving elements we see or use when browsing webpages
            are actually hard coded in with physics we experience in the real world. I know that some websites have animations in the background that move depending on how 
            "hard" you scroll and I wanted to find out more about this. I found a great example of a background to a website that was bubbles that reacted to
            the user scrolling on the page. A very informative article from 
            <a href = "https://codersblock.com/blog/physics-based-background-scroll-effects/">CodersBlock</a> helped me better understand how a combination of
            css and javascript is able to accomplish this kind of effect on a website. As for the physics, this solution used an engine with gravity
            and other various physical aspects loaded into it so I did not see too much under the hood of that but I got to learn how it was implemented in
            html on a webpage.<br>
            <br>
            I also was curious about the converse effect, which is when the background stays relatively stagnant as a user scrolls through the page.
            This is much less complicated as no complicated engines or math is required to code it. A useful tutorial from 
            <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-attachment.asp"> W3Schools</a> along with the 
            <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_background-attachment_fixed"> code snippet</a> they provided
            , I was able to get a very good understanding about how I may be able to incorporate it into a website I build for this class. I believe this would 
            fit very well into the minimalistic website I am trying to make for project 1.
            <br>
            <br>
            I feel much more confident in implementing the second solution into my project as it stands right now but I am curious and want to continue to learn about
            the various things that can be done with physics on a webpage to make a website more attractive. I also would like to spice up this website a little better
            so you have something more pleasing to look at when you read my blog.
