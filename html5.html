        <h1>Week 6 Blog Post</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div> This week, as we have been exploring javascript and its usefulness more lately, I decided to look into some cool javascript libraries. I simply searched "cool and useful javascript"
            libraries on google and found a few that seemed promising. One of the libraries on this list was anime.js which I wrote about on a previous weeks blog post so this list seemed 
            trustworthy. One particular library that caught my eye was the D3.js library which was excellenet for data science and data visualization, what particularly caught my attention was that
            it this library was used by the author of the article to visulaize the COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins, the map that many people used this summer to view the spread of coronacirus
            accross the world. Setting up the graph element is easy and I found some snippets online that show how it is implemented:

             <br><br>

             
            <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                
                    // set the dimensions and margins of the graph
                    var margin = {top: 10, right: 40, bottom: 30, left: 30},
                        width = 450 - margin.left - margin.right,
                        height = 400 - margin.top - margin.bottom;
                    
                    // append the svg object to the body of the page
                    var sVg = d3.select("#Area")
                      .append("svg")
                        .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right)
                        .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
                      // translate this svg element to leave some margin.
                      .append("g")
                        .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");
                    
                    // X scale and Axis
                    var x = d3.scaleLinear()
                        .domain([0, 100])         // This is the min and the max of the data: 0 to 100 if percentages
                        .range([0, width]);       // This is the corresponding value I want in Pixel
                    sVg
                      .append('g')
                      .attr("transform", "translate(0," + height + ")")
                      .call(d3.axisBottom(x));
                    
                    // X scale and Axis
                    var y = d3.scaleLinear()
                        .domain([0, 100])         // This is the min and the max of the data: 0 to 100 if percentages
                        .range([height, 0]);       // This is the corresponding value I want in Pixel
                    sVg
                      .append('g')
                      .call(d3.axisLeft(y));
                
            </code>

        <p> 
           My double major is in Economics, so data and data visualization is something that I would like to learn how to do if I were ever to want to organize my own website that involved some sort
           of data models. The function scaleLinear() seems to make it very easy to size graphs as a beginner which I as a beginner would probably not have known how to do without the aid 
           of the library. I also found a way that is somewhat similar to how canvas displays grade distributions with a box plot
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                
                // Compute summary statistics used for the box:
                var data_sorted = data.sort(d3.ascending)
                var q1 = d3.quantile(data_sorted, .25)
                var median = d3.quantile(data_sorted, .5)
                var q3 = d3.quantile(data_sorted, .75)
                var interQuantileRange = q3 - q1
                var min = q1 - 1.5 * interQuantileRange
                var max = q1 + 1.5 * interQuantileRange
                
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p> 
                The quantile function call in this example makes it very easy to compute the q1, median, and q3 sections of a box plot very simple. All in all I think that there are many uses 
                for this library and as a person with a knack for data like me I feel that learning it will be fun!
