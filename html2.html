        <h1>Week 3 Blog Post</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>This week I wanted to find ways that I could spice up my website a little more for project 1. My client is my friend who is a graphical designer
            so I feel like having a very aesthetically pleasing website is crucial to his image. I first looked for a bunch of portfolio websites that looked
            good to me and I went with those. I noticed that parralax scrolling on websites has become very popular, and it looked good on the websites that I saw it
            on. I went to my go to source, which was W3 schools, and read up on parallax scrolling. The code was some pretty simple css:
            <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                .parallax {
                    /* The image used */
                    background-image: url('img_parallax.jpg');
                  
                    /* Full height */
                    height: 100%; 
                  
                    /* Create the parallax scrolling effect */
                    background-attachment: fixed;
                    background-position: center;
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-size: cover;
                  }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>This is a fairly simple implementation and I do remember this being shown in class so if my website ends up having this element to it I 
        plan on adding it. I actually added it to this blog post to test it out!</p>

        <p>Another thing I wanted to add, but is a bit more complicated, is a fading slideshow on the homepage for featured content.
            The idea for my client is that the content he chooses to be displayed on the home page will have a slideshow with each slide
            being some work that he has either done or is in progress. The slideshow will be navigable (left and right) with buttons on either
            side of the photo being displayed. I found another solution to this on W3 schools but it involves a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
            The javascript below is simply looping over the slide deck to determine the slide that should be displayed, and at the end looping back 
            to the beginning.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                function showSlides(n) {
                    var i;
                    var slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
                    var dots = document.getElementsByClassName("dot");
                    if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}    
                    if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
                    for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
                        slides[i].style.display = "none";  
                    }
                    for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) {
                        dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", "");
                    }
                    slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";  
                    dots[slideIndex-1].className += " active";
                  }
            </code>
        </pre>
        My goal is to go through more of the code that would allow me to create a slideshow on the homepage, and somehow find a way to make it so the 
        slideshow is on autoloop whether or not the user is scrolling through it. This was something I included in my wireframe so it is defeintely something
        I would like to include. Hope you enjoyed reading about my progress, thanks for all your help this week!<br> <br>
