            Per your recommendation I did some learning on redux for my blog post this week. It seems that it will be a very useful
            tool to supplement what we have learned thus far, and I am exicted to get to learn more about it. Some of the content
            in this class that we have learned after the midterm has been a little confusing to me but I have been doing my best to
            follow along. With redux it seems that it makes the code very manageable and it clearly defined through the use of actions
            to track what the code is doing. I was reading on redux.js.org and there were a lot fo good informative pages about 
            getting started with redux. In the following small code snippet that they provided on their tutorial page that shows two
            reducers being created for a webpage, and a third reducer that manages both of them for the whole app.
             <br><br>
            <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
                    if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
                      return action.filter
                    } else {
                      return state
                    }
                  }
                  
                  function todos(state = [], action) {
                    switch (action.type) {
                      case 'ADD_TODO':
                        return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])
                      case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
                        return state.map((todo, index) =>
                          action.index === index
                            ? { text: todo.text, completed: !todo.completed }
                            : todo
                        )
                      default:
                        return state
                    }
                  }
                  
                  function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
                    return {
                      todos: todos(state.todos, action),
                      visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)
                    }
                  }
                
            </code>
            </pre>

        <p> 
            The third function is the reducer that manages the app in this case. I understand that this is redux being implemented
            in its simplest form but I felt like reading through the core concepts page oin the redux.js website helped me get a deeper
            understanding of what is going on under the hood. I looked through the documentation further and found many more ways
            in which redux can be utilized to build an efficient dynamic website like we are doing for project 2. I found one of the libraries
            on github that was linked that they noted as very useful for manipulating datastructures. In the small snippet shown below
            they simply have an increment and decrement function in the reducer that can be useful for managing stacks or queues in a programs.
            
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code id = "code">
                const myCounter = counter({
                    incrementActionTypes: ['INCREMENT'],
                    decrementActionTypes: ['DECREMENT']
                  })
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p> 
            I plan on going through the labs and lectures again from the twodee.org pages for our class to gain a deeper understanding 
            of whats going on because I still am somewhat confused with the mechanics of everything, but I am confident that I will be
            able to implement this framework in my project 2 submission. Thanks for reading!
